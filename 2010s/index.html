		<h1> Types of Hackers</h1>
		<hr>
		<br>
		<p>Using the term hacking or hacker usually has a negative connotation in its definition. Malicious hackers are often highly skilled in coding and programming, and modifying computer software and hardware systems to gain unauthorized access. However, not all hackers are created equal, and they’re not always cybercriminals.
        Hacking consists of conducting technical activities with the intent of exploiting vulnerabilities within a computer system, network or firewall to obtain unauthorized access. It involves misusing digital devices such as computers, networks, smartphones and tablets.
        <br>
		<br>
        The goal of hacking is to manipulate digital devices in order to cause damage or corrupt operating systems. It also allows hackers to collect user information, steal sensitive information and documents or perform other disruptive data related activities.
        <br>
		<br>
        While hackers can be both ethical and malicious, most fall within three main types of hacking. These three main varieties of hackers are authorized, unauthorized and grey-hat hackers. Each type has different intents and purposes for their exploits. Let's explore each of these types of hackers and how they operate.

			<h1>How Ethical Hackers Differ From Malicious Hackers</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Ethical hackers work with companies, the government and other organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities in their systems. This intel can be used to fix security issues and vulnerabilities before adversaries have a chance to exploit them.
				<br>
				There are several significant other ways that ethical hacking is different from malicious hacking:
				<ul>
					<li>Ethical hackers are hired to test vulnerability and not steal anything from the systems they’re testing. Their main goal is to only look for gaps in the system's security defenses.</li>
					<li>Ethical hackers utilize several methods to test systems apart from just attempting to gain access through illegal pathways. These paths can include brute force attacks or using keyloggers to reveal user-password vulnerability. They will also utilize legal methods of gaining access that mirror real-world attackers, known as the ethical hacking methodology.</li>
					<li>Ethical hackers follow a strict code of ethics when conducting the tests that guide their work. This code prohibits them from sharing how they breached security measures with anyone outside the client or organization. As a result, most companies and organizations are more likely to trust an ethical hacker.</li>
		
				</ul>

			<h1>Roles and Responsibilities of Ethical Hackers</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Ethical hackers often have job responsibilities that go beyond lawfully hacking systems for security issues. The primary goal of an ethical hacker is to test and identify vulnerabilities in an organization's system and correct them.
			   <br>
				Ethical hackers are expected to follow specific guidelines to perform hacking for organizations legally. These guidelines include approval from the system owner before executing the security review.
			   <br>  				
			   The additional roles and responsibilities of an ethical hacker include:
			</p>
			<ul>

				<li>
				Discovering the operating system and network weaknesses in an organization's technology infrastructure.
				</li>
				<li>
				Demonstrating how easy it is to launch cyberattacks on their company using penetration-testing methods.
				</li>
				<li>
				Executing security assessment simulations to show how easily they could be hacked by someone else.
				</li>
				<li>
				Reporting any security breaches and vulnerabilities discovered within the system or network directly to the owner or manager of that system.
				</li>
				<li>
				Keeping the discoveries confidential between them and the client or company.
				</li>
				<li>
				Wiping traces of the hack to ensure that malicious hackers cannot enter the system through the identified loopholes.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Skills and Certifications Required for Ethical Hackers</h1>
		<hr>
   		<p>
        Ethical hacking is a technology career with specific skills, and cybersecurity certifications help people break into the field. Many ethical hacking jobs still require a bachelor's degree in information technology, or another technology or cybersecurity related degree. However more employers are considering candidates without degrees in favor of experience and certifications. The most proficient ethical hackers have a combination of a degree, experience and certifications.
        <br>
		<br>
        Ethical hackers should also have a working knowledge of infrastructure technology including Linux servers, Cisco network controls, virtualization, Citrix and Microsoft Exchange. Computer programming experience and understanding of various programming languages is required for advanced positions.
        <br>
		<br>
        Many employers will require ethical hackers to have certifications in addition to their degree and experience. CompTIA PenTest+ and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) through EC-Council are among the most recognized industry certifications. They cover the skills and knowledge needed by experts in information security and ethical hacking.
        <br>
		<br>
        Ethical hackers also need strong analytical skills, given that the work involves examining data to identify potential issues. Therefore, to break into this field, you must also have superior problem-solving skills, creative strategy skills and attention to detail. These skills are necessary, as ethical hackers must be thorough in their efforts to breach the security systems.
        <br>
		<br>
        Regular re-certification is necessary to stay up to date with this industry. Continued education on the latest penetration software and industry recommendations can also be beneficial for ethical hackers in their careers.

			<h1>Limitations to Ethical Hacking</h1>
			<hr>
	
	<br>
    <p>
		
         Although ethical hacking is a type of penetration testing, it uses attack simulations and methods to assess the system and network, reinforcing that there’s more to ethical hacking than just penetration testing.
        Many ethical hackers need to be multifaced in not only thinking like a hacker but moving like one as well. They need to know how they operate, what they use, and the tools used to employ countermeasures against the system and network vulnerabilities – while remaining within the bounds of the laws and permissions.
        <br>
		<br>
        Ethical hacking is also often compared with vulnerability or risk assessments. Vulnerability assessment (VA) takes place before penetration testing begins. A VA can scan for security vulnerabilities on a system or network without exploiting them. This is done to determine weaknesses in said system or network before taking further action to mitigate them.
        Ethical hacking often involves many different facets of the information security field. This role requires a lot of knowledge and expertise, from coding and programming to penetration testing and risk assessment. There is a lot to learn within the ethical hacking career, but it’s a high-demand field that will only continue to grow the more technology is used in our world.
