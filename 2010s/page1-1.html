    <h1>Unauthorized Hackers</h1>
    <p>
        Unauthorized hackers, also called black-hat hackers, are malicious types of hackers. These hackers often use their technical skills and knowledge to seize control of computers and operating systems with the intent of stealing valuable data. Unauthorized hackers will utilize many methods to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks to steal sensitive organization or individual data.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unauthorized hackers are often the criminals behind many significant data breaches and exploits. Most of them commonly use malware, social engineering and denial of service tactics to execute attacks against organizations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unauthorized hackers may act on their own, as part of a larger cybercrime organization or on behalf of an enemy nation-state. Most are motivated by reputation, monetary gain, or espionage conducted on both nation-states and corporations.
