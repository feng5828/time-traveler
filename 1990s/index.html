	<h1 align="center">❶ Types of Hackers</h1>
	<center><img src="assets/types.jpg"></center>
    <p1>Using the term hacking or hacker usually has a negative connotation in its definition. Malicious hackers are often highly skilled in coding and programming, and modifying computer software and hardware systems to gain unauthorized access. However, not all hackers are created equal, and they’re not always cybercriminals.
        <br>
        Hacking consists of conducting technical activities with the intent of exploiting vulnerabilities within a computer system, network or firewall to obtain unauthorized access. It involves misusing digital devices such as computers, networks, smartphones and tablets.
        <br>
        The goal of hacking is to manipulate digital devices in order to cause damage or corrupt operating systems. It also allows hackers to collect user information, steal sensitive information and documents or perform other disruptive data related activities.
        <br>
        While hackers can be both ethical and malicious, most fall within three main types of hacking. These three main varieties of hackers are authorized, unauthorized and grey-hat hackers. Each type has different intents and purposes for their exploits. Let's explore each of these types of hackers and how they operate.

	<h1 align="center">❷ How Ethical Hackers Differ From Malicious Hackers</h1>
	<center><img src="assets/differences.jpg"></center>
	<br>
    <p1>
        Ethical hackers work with companies, the government and other organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities in their systems. This intel can be used to fix security issues and vulnerabilities before adversaries have a chance to exploit them.
        <br>
        There are several significant other ways that ethical hacking is different from malicious hacking:
        <ul>
            <li>Ethical hackers are hired to test vulnerability and not steal anything from the systems they’re testing. Their main goal is to only look for gaps in the system's security defenses.</li>
	        <li>Ethical hackers utilize several methods to test systems apart from just attempting to gain access through illegal pathways. These paths can include brute force attacks or using keyloggers to reveal user-password vulnerability. They will also utilize legal methods of gaining access that mirror real-world attackers, known as the ethical hacking methodology.</li>
	        <li>Ethical hackers follow a strict code of ethics when conducting the tests that guide their work. This code prohibits them from sharing how they breached security measures with anyone outside the client or organization. As a result, most companies and organizations are more likely to trust an ethical hacker.</li>

        </ul>
    </p1>

	<h1 align="center">❸ Roles and Responsibilities of Ethical Hackers</h1>
	<center><img src="assets/responsibilities.jpg"></center>
	<br>
    <p1>
        Ethical hackers often have job responsibilities that go beyond lawfully hacking systems for security issues. The primary goal of an ethical hacker is to test and identify vulnerabilities in an organization's system and correct them.
       <br>
        Ethical hackers are expected to follow specific guidelines to perform hacking for organizations legally. These guidelines include approval from the system owner before executing the security review.
       <br>

	<center><img src="assets/tools.jpg"></center>
	<p1>Mainly three tools are used nowadays.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<table border="2">
        <tr>
            <th>⓵ Namp</th>
            <th>⓶ Wireshark</th>
            <th>③ Burp Suite</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Is one of the most popular network scanning and mapping tools. Its built-in scripting library can scan for open ports and check for vulnerabilities.

	<h1 align="center">❻ Limitations to Ethical Hacking</h1>
	<center><img src="assets/limitations.jpg"></center>
	<ins>Ethical hacking can often have a misunderstood scope and limit within the industry.</ins>
	<br>
	<br>
    <p1>
         Although ethical hacking is a type of penetration testing, it uses attack simulations and methods to assess the system and network, reinforcing that there’s more to ethical hacking than just penetration testing.
        <br>
        Many ethical hackers need to be multifaced in not only thinking like a hacker but moving like one as well. They need to know how they operate, what they use, and the tools used to employ countermeasures against the system and network vulnerabilities – while remaining within the bounds of the laws and permissions.
        <br>
        Ethical hacking is also often compared with vulnerability or risk assessments. Vulnerability assessment (VA) takes place before penetration testing begins. A VA can scan for security vulnerabilities on a system or network without exploiting them. This is done to determine weaknesses in said system or network before taking further action to mitigate them.
        <br>
        Ethical hacking often involves many different facets of the information security field. This role requires a lot of knowledge and expertise, from coding and programming to penetration testing and risk assessment. There is a lot to learn within the ethical hacking career, but it’s a high-demand field that will only continue to grow the more technology is used in our world.
